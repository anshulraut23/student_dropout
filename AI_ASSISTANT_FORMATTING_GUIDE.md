# AI Assistant - Professional Formatting Guide

## Overview
The AI Assistant now generates professionally formatted reports with tables, bold fonts, emojis, and structured layouts for better readability.

## Formatting Features

### 1. Tables
All structured data is presented in clean, aligned tables:

**Example: Student Report - Basic Information**
```
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Class | N3 |
| Roll Number | 15 |
| Report Period | Jan 29, 2026 to Feb 28, 2026 |

## Frontend Rendering

### Table Rendering
Tables are automatically detected by `|` separators and rendered with:
- Header rows with bold text and gray background
- Aligned columns with proper spacing
- Border between rows
- Responsive layout

### Text Formatting
- **Bold headers**: Larger font, bold weight, proper spacing
- **Bullet points**: Blue bullets with proper indentation
- **Sub-bullets**: Gray bullets with extra indentation
- **Empty lines**: Proper spacing between sections

### Color Scheme
- Headers: Dark slate (slate-800)
- Regular text: Medium slate (slate-700)
- Bullets: Blue (blue-500)
- Sub-bullets: Light slate (slate-400)
- Table headers: Dark slate with light background (slate-900, bg-slate-100)
- Borders: Light slate (slate-200)

## Benefits

1. **Professional Appearance**: Reports look polished and organized
